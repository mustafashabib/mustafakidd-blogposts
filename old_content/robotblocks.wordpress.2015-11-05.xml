				<title>BE NICE</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have a framed <a title="Anthony Burrill's work" href="http://www.anthonyburrill.com/purchase/work-hard.html">picture</a> at <a title="We Are Mammoth" href="http://wearemammoth.com">our office</a> that says "Work Hard and Be Nice to People". Simple and pithy? Yes, of course - all good mantras need to be.

As my years in the industry have inched past a decade, I've been exposed to more and more types of projects, unique (sometimes great, sometimes not so great) personalities, and various hot new tech fads that will Solve Everything. The more things change, though, the more I keep coming back to <strong>this</strong> idea as the <strong>single most important </strong>point in my personal Code Of Ethics. Work Hard. Be Nice to people.

<!--more-->

I've been fortunate enough to work with some <a title="Adam Hoffman" href="http://www.stratospher.es/">amazing</a> <a title="Ka Wai Cheung's The Developer's Code" href="http://www.thedeveloperscode.com/">folks</a> over the years that have helped cement, for me, the understanding that while talent and skill are indeed huge components to each of our successes and paths in life, they're usurped by the attitude with which you approach difficult situations. The attitude helps define how we spend our day to day and the environments we live and work in.  Nothing counts as much as<strong> being a nice person: </strong>To care about your work but also to care about the your coworkers' and clients' struggles and to lend a helping hand.

I'm always more interested in working with people who are nice, who care about the people they're working with, and want to help ease their pain when facing problems. Who you are when things are going swell is one thing, but what you did and how you acted when things were tough are often the brief moments that crystallize who you are, both to yourself and to those around you.

The dynamic that's emitted from relationships where everyone cares about one another can overcome any difficulty regardless of the expertise of each individual involved who is working on the problem. I'll take a handful of folks who care about each other, who know enough to get their bearings, and who want to see each other through any problems over a handful of domain experts who don't care to help you if it doesn't suit their personal schedule or needs, who point to their job description anytime requests come to them and say "<em>that's not my</em> job", or who reluctantly do you the favor of giving you a few moments of their time when you need it most - that sort of attitude is the tech office equivalent of <a href="http://lakersblog.latimes.com/.a/6a00d8341c506253ef015435900d7c970c-600wi">locker room poison</a>. People quickly learn to work around such obstacles at the cost of effort and time, our most important resources, and "one bad apple" can demoralize an entire group and sap them of motivation and energy. I've seen groups coalesce into those who work well with one another and those who don't, causing further schism within an office and more tension and lack of trust than anyone would deem healthy. You spend so much of your time around your clients and coworkers that it makes no sense not to be nice. Why would you want to spend a third of your day, and probably close to half of your waking day, being a grump and offering resistance each time you have the opportunity to be flexible?]]></content:encoded>

				<title>MAKE MISTAKES</title>
		<link>http://www.mustafakidd.com/make-mistakes/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A couple of days ago, <a title="DoneDone" href="http://www.getdonedone.com">DoneDone</a> - the issue tracking tool (for humans) that I help work on at <a title="We Are Mammoth" href="http://wearemammoth.com">WAM</a> - experienced some downtime due to a server update which inadvertently rebooted our servers. While the fact that DoneDone was down for a short period wasn't anyone's idea of ideal, I can't help but get excited when we make mistakes because mistakes are the only currency I can create, and I can spend that currency on lessons that help make our organization better.

<!--more-->As WAM has grown over the years from a small group of guys in a tiny room to a team of (as of today) 18 - 12 of whom are developers - our growth has offered us lots of opportunities to make a lot of mistakes. I'm proud to say that we've all taken full advantage of these opportunities, probably with myself leading the way.

In lots of other places I've been, the company culture was one where people fear mistakes. Fear making them. Fear admitting that they've made them, and Fear of the repercussions of making them: Fear of the inevitable is not healthy and is <strong>not a culture I value.</strong> This fear tends to create a more brittle organization, where nobody is flexible enough to take chances on new ideas, where fear freezes people's ability to take a thought, massage it into an idea, and develop it with others into a full fledged solution to a problem. Being flexible is a base requirement to being innovative, and innovation breeds solutions, and solutions are valuable. Anything to get us to that end should be celebrated. When you value mistakes, your organization from top to bottom can participate in improving instead of hiding their mistakes - which often lead to even bigger problems which cause even more difficulty for both the organization and the stakeholders you aim to serve.

So, here's how it works - when we make a mistake - <strong>we call on others to help us solve the problem at hand, immediately. </strong>It helps if your organization values <a title="BE NICE" href="http://www.mustafakidd.com/?p=101">being nice</a>. Once the fallout of the mistake is identified, corrected, and an honest explanation of what went wrong has been shared with everyone affected, we can begin learning from this mistake. We meet to discuss what went wrong, we ask each other - why did we do whatever it was we did that caused this mistake, and what made us think it was the right thing to do? When it makes sense, we document those reasons and we collectively decide how we can best capture a method or process which will help us avoid making these decisions in the future. We aim to fold it into our process, we may add it to our manual checklists, we decide if blocking certain actions in any automated systems we have in place makes sense. We learn from them, we get better, and we move forward with a better product, a better organization, and a more experienced and knowledgable team.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>VACUUMS SUCK</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's common in technical fields to attract the more introverted personalities. Often, they've honed their skills over a period of years, working alone in their bedrooms and offices, absorbing content from manuals and documentation that nobody else reads. Even in today's hyper-connected world where there's a forum of likeminded individuals studying the same fields you're interested in, it's still very much mostly a solo endeavor. At the end of the day, you still need to sit down and create and implement a design, write code, test, deploy, and any number of other tasks related to today's tech world - and do it alone.

Because of this, there's a tendency for these personalities to retain a go at it alone attitude, even when working side by side with others in an organization on a complex project with many moving parts. This is true in a large organizations as well as small: In <a title="We Are Mammoth" href="http://wearemammoth.com">our company</a>, which is still tiny at under 20 people, <strong>attempting to work in a vacuum often creates problems</strong>.

<!--more-->
<h4>The Cost of Grinding It Out</h4>
It isn't that there's no benefit to <a href="http://wearemammoth.com/2010/04/off-time-pragmatic-solution-to-leaving">alone time</a> -- there's obviously a need and a great deal of <a title="37s Alone Time" href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch07_Alone_Time.php" target="_blank">value</a> to it. The problems occur when you're so focused on the one task you have at hand that you don't bother to see how the part you're working on fits in with the components around it. You've created the proverbial square peg, which will soon need to be pounded in to the round hole that your teammates have just finished delicately carving out.

Additionally, when coupled with a <a title="MAKE MISTAKES" href="http://www.mustafakidd.com/?p=191" target="_blank">fear of making mistakes</a> and a crisis situation, working alone can very easily create more problems than what you were first confronted with. Soloists won't as readily share information so that the right people are notified, so stakeholders can put into action plans that may already be in place, and so that customers can be updated and expectations can be squared away. When you don't share problems, especially in a crisis, you become a part of the problem and introduce a bottle neck in the team's ability to solve it.

Lastly, <a title="MJ Gets Mad At Slash" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lxN7x8JVKM&amp;feature=g-vrec" target="_blank">soloing often <strong>wastes time</strong></a>. So often have I struggled with an issue, deep within the bowels of some ancient legacy code, when I suddenly emerge through the fog into a moment of clarity and realize: I should ask someone else around here what they think! When I do, we often discover the answer immediately due to some esoteric knowledge they had and I didn't. Keeping my head down and slogging through it, while often an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Mizrachi">admirable skill</a>, ends up being the wrong choice most of the time purely from an efficiency standpoint. For those of us lucky enough to work with <a href="http://wearemammoth.com/about#content">talented people</a>, <strong>not relying on their expertise is a wasted opportunity.</strong> It's a waste of resources and a wasted chance for you to learn something new - it's also a wasted chance for <strong>them </strong>to learn how to better publicize their knowledge, how to educate those around them, and how to improve the team in general.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As of late, there's a <a href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure">lot</a> of <a href="http://rainypixels.com/words/the-story-of-the-new-microsoft-com/">great</a> <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/">stuff</a> I <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en/us/default.aspx">like</a> about what Microsoft has been up to. They're more open, more transparent, and more connected than they've ever been - and I think the result of all this is a more relevant company than they've been in a long time. Today, Microsoft announced <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> as one more attempt to reach out to developers, make their lives easier, and make the web a more open place and a platform that's easier than ever to develop for.

<a href="http://tirania.org/blog">Miguel de Icaza</a> does a <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2012/Oct-01.html">great job</a> rounding up the pros and cons of this release, so I won't rehash it here. I think some of the cons and barriers to adoptability that he mentions Linux and Mac developers will face shouldn't be barriers for very long. Some of the initial syntax definitions <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/interoperability/archive/2012/10/01/sublime-text-vi-emacs-typescript-enabled.aspx">available</a> already make this more attractive to non Windows developers.

All in all - I think it's a worthy contribution to the landscape and, along with some other <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dart/">excellent tools</a> addressing similar problems and having similar goals, it only adds to developer's abilities to efficiently write <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Solid-Microsoft-Programming-Series/dp/1556155514">solid code</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote cite="http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/cargocul.htm">In the South Seas there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw
airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want the same
thing to happen now. So they've arranged to imitate things like
runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a
wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head
like headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas--he's
the controller--and they wait for the airplanes to land. They're
doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the
way it looked before. But it doesn't work. No airplanes land. So
I call these things cargo cult science, because they follow all the
apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but
they're missing something essential, because the planes don't land.

<footer>— CARGO CULT SCIENCE by Richard Feynman</footer></blockquote>
<!--more-->
Richard Feynman gave a great <a title="Cargo Cult Science" href="http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/cargocul.htm">commencent address</a> in 1974 at Caltech which wonderfully described the "leaning over backwards" we must all strive for when presenting our ideas to others for judgement on their worthiness and value. The main thrust of his speech was aimed at helping us avoid the mistakes of hiding the truth, presenting only certain facts, or generally misleading people to support our ideas by not laying all evidence out in public for everyone to make up their own minds about. The integrity required to behave in this manner - to be as open about your failings as you are about your successes - is of the utmost importance for each of us to be true to ourselves and doubly as important to ensure that we can trust one another. Without this integrity and trust, cooperation could be stifled, and thus progress.

Perhaps surprisingly, this trust can only be achieved when we each make the effort to fully vet and understand other's claims, to ensure we are all working with the same basic knowledge, and to know when things are right or when they are wrong. It is not enough just to take other's results, methodology, or process and expect to be able to build something stable upon it.
<h4>Dig Deeper</h4>
In technology, it reminds me a great deal of the importance of <strong>digging deeper</strong>. Too often, I come across code that <em>looks </em>like code I've seen before - it seems to follow a certain organizational pattern, but then has some huge core component missing. In these cases, it's clear that the developer has taken it upon themselves to don the bamboo headphones and wait for the never arriving planes of the cargo cult and is merely <strong>mimicking</strong> someone else's poorly understood success and hoping to find success of their own.

Feynman's advice is as sound for us developers as it is for anyone else: understand the reasons, the context, and the methods to replicate someone else's success before deciding that you should build a superficial clone of their ideas. You may find that their solution was very particular, specific to a need you do not have - or perhaps you'll find that it's actually not that great of a solution to begin with. In other cases, you'll understand some deeper meaning behind their results and process, and can thus leverage it for your own experiments and work in a way that has true value instead of just as window dressing.
<h4>Skepticism</h4>
Though it seems obvious, I can't stress enough the importance of being skeptical to allow you to build a stronger foundation of knowledge. Understanding the hows and whys of new tools and methodologies on your own  must be a core requirement before you can apply them and their lessons to your own work. A good idea will be supported by good reasoning, by transparency, and by repeatability. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't quite explain to yourself why you're doing something a certain way, pause and ask yourself whether you understand it or whether you're out in the South Pacific somewhere waiting for the planes to come.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>RELAX</title>
		<link>http://www.mustafakidd.com/relax/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While listening to a <a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/post/2-0-2-pressure">great interview</a> over at <a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/">This Developer's Life</a>, I started thinking about how I personally deal with stress and pressure. We've had our share of catastrophes at <a href="http://wearemammoth.com">WAM</a>, like everyone in the game of software development it comes with the territory whether it's working on client projects or your own products. The scenarios are the same: something isn't working the way it's supposed to work, there's a problem you never saw before, and someone is upset - worse:<strong> they're looking at you to fix it</strong>.

Like so many times in life, you have two paths you can choose to follow in these situations, the way I see it. You can Panic or you can Relax.

I, being a child of the 80s, will always and forever listen to Frankie, and Frankie says "Relax". In addition to being an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyl5DlrsU90">amazing dance song</a>, it's also sound advice in almost any situation where it is an option.

<!--more-->
<h4>Think Clearly</h4>
Being able to maintain a calm demeanor helps tremendously when you're faced with a stressful situation. For the type of software many of us work on, luckily, the true cost of the error is typically not measured in things that really count. Certainly it may cost money, it may affect your or your company's credibility (perhaps, but more on this later), or it may cost your customers annoyances and trouble which in turn domino and create losses for them as well. Yes, these things are real and should be avoided. Still, I can't help but keep things in perspective and try and relate these stresses to the entire realm of possible stresses that we can encounter in our lives, and happily I can say that the majority of problems fall on the "minor" end of the scale.

This perspective also lets me keep my wits about me and allow me to approach the problem in a systematic way. I can follow the process I would normally follow when investigating a problem under less stressful or hurried circumstances. When you let the heat of the moment engulf you, it clouds your judgement. It makes you panic and rush to implement "solutions" which end up triggering more problems. You'll make changes to your system without testing, without vetting on another environment, without documenting it - all of which will cost you again, later. When you panic you pull at straws, and while you may get lucky and find solutions more quickly this way, careful investigation is much more likely to lead to a real understanding of your problems and how to fix them.

Staying relaxed also shouldn't be seen as a sign that you don't care or that you're in no rush to fix the issue. Instead, it speaks more to how you approach problem solving, about how well you know your system, how well you can explain what happened, and how well you can talk about the steps you've taken to prevent it from happening again. Your co-workers, clients, and customers will all appreciate having you on their side when problems occur and you have a track record of solving them in this clear and concise way.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>COMMIT CRIMES BADLY</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you've spent any time at all developing software, you've - willingly or unwillingly - had to come to terms with the fact that a huge part of your job isn't writing new code, but is instead about playing detective and recreating causes to problems so that you could fix them.
<!--more-->
Here, your job as detective can be made much easier when the coder version of you - the criminal in this metaphor - has left behind <strong>obvious and </strong><strong>useful clues </strong>as to what's going on within your system. Future you, your current and future coworkers, and people you'll never meet will some day thank you. When you have to go through systems trying to solve obscure issues that have brought your app to its knees - and the boss, standing over your slumped in distress shoulders with a scowl on his face, to your desk - these clues will be like water on the parched lips of a man lost in the desert. 

One of the first places you'll look to when faced with an unknown problem will be whatever logs you've thought to generate as the system is running. These logs contain a great deal of evidence, clues, eye witness accounts, and direction that can help you piece together exactly what's going on. They can also become a source of frustration if they were created carelessly or if they generate so much information that they're basically useless. Just as with any other tool, it's important that you understand how to best use their unique features to your advantage to help you make your life easier.

Just like comments, logs help you understand what's going on, and just as comments such as:

<code> //adding one to the variable x
x += 1;
</code>

Tell you basically...nothing, a log like:

<code> 2013-04-18--[3] - ERROR - Something bad happened with the input.
</code>

Is equally useless. While grep will be your savior in pinpointing errors, keeping your logs clear will allow you to find these errors more quickly and generally keep your system more maintainable, just as writing clean code keeps your code base clearer.

Generally, the following guidelines work well for me, but as always it's important that you figure out what will work for you and your team:

<strong>DEBUG</strong>: Here I log everything that I'll want to know as I'm developing and debugging my code. This is stuff that's helpful when I'm first building my system and helps me get a very detailed idea of what's going on, but stuff that I wouldn't miss when it comes time to solve production problems.

<strong>INFO</strong>: General business logic messages, progress, etc.

<strong>WARN</strong>: Recoverable issues, typically things like missing configuration values where the code reverts to some sane default value.

<strong>ERROR</strong>: Serious and unrecoverable issues. These will be what you grep through your logs looking for and logging non errors at this level will make your life Very Difficult when trouble comes knocking. Your database is down, your caching server isn't responding, etc.

Again, these are just my general guidelines - the point is that I want to log as much information as I'll need when something bad happens - and nothing more. There are a lot more<a title="Great logging tips from Julius Davies" href="http://juliusdavies.ca/logging.html"> detailed and great logging tips</a> out there, if you want do a <a title="DON’T JOIN A CARGO CULT" href="http://www.mustafakidd.com/?p=391">deeper dive</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's well known that a major component to a successful user experience is absolute consistency. Apple does this better than almost anyone, and as their desktop and mobile OS quickly merge it will become even more consistent than it already is today.  For the most part Microsoft is a close second, and I say this even after factoring in the fact that the new Metro UI has a <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/windows-8.html">certain</a> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/08/hands-on-with-windows-8-rtm-software-is-finished-the-experience-aint/">disjointed</a> <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/windows-8--disjointed--and--remarkable-.html">feel</a> to it of something new bolted onto something old. In fact, their consistency has opened them up to criticism: <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/07/betting-the-company-on-windows-8.html">Windows 7 wasn't so different from Win95</a>, after all.

<!--more-->

Google, on the other hand, fails this test constantly.  The only consistency I feel across their brand is that it is rarely consistent. Open up Gmail, Reader, Youtube, and the Calendar in different tabs and switch between them. You'll see a number of these <em>similar but different </em>controls jumping around the layout and changing shape, size, and style creating a disharmony across their brand. Why the inconsistency?

Worse, yet, is when different products behave differently when I perform the same action. When I'm on the main Google search page and start typing, my keyboard's focus is locked to the search bar and each character I type or erase updates the results list in real time. This means that the use of the backspace key for browser navigation, which has been the default on a variety of browsers for years, is overridden and in fact cannot be used. In Gmail, an entirely new set of keyboard shortcuts exist and your keyboard focus is <strong>not</strong> locked to the search bar. Indeed, when you type in the search bar here, you get a recommendation list of contacts and items across the web (though it doesn't seem your actual mail messages are searched). While I appreciate that the <strong>result</strong> of the action is contextual and correlated to the likely primary intent of the user depending on the product, the lack of consistency in <strong>how </strong>the result of the action is presented does nothing but add confusion to my experience, and <a href="http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/reader/something-is-broken/Df17P1kN8C4">I'm not alone</a> in feeling this way.

There's clearly a lot going on across Google's portfolio of products, products I use every day and for the most part rely on and love to use.  From a pure usefulness standpoint, their work is amazing and will continue to be a cornerstone of billions of people's daily workflow. It's also why improving their UX design is extremely important - each of those few seconds users waste making decisions related to the differences between their products sum to an enormous amount of collective time wasted.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>APPRECIATE YOUR ANCESTORS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the principles I live by both in my professional as well as personal life is to appreciate what's come before me. Recognizing that while there are often opportunities for improvement, decisions made before you were around are what allowed you the opportunity you have today to make things better.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I again thought about this as I read a <a title="Ricky James interviewed by the New Yorker" href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1993/04/05/1993_04_05_054_TNY_CARDS_000362341?currentPage=all">great interview with Ricky James that the New Yorker published back in 1993</a>. Ricky is held in extremely high regard by all those familiar with him - from fans to most importantly his own peers - for his considerable technical and social skills, style, wit, and charm. What elevates Ricky above the rest, I'd argue however, is his deep held respect for the past and for those that came before him, paving the road he walks today.</p>
<h1>He’s appalled that they haven’t read this stuff</h1>
<p>Though it's given him the reputation as being aloof, Ricky's inability to comprehend his supposed peer's disinterest in their craft and their lack of education and commitment to it is precisely what allows him to reintroduce techniques and tricks that nobody else is capable of, let alone aware of.</p>
<p>We can all learn a valuable lesson from Ricky James' commitment to history and to learning, even if we aren't necessarily in his league (yet!) as far as our relative expertise in our chosen fields goes. Ricky's refusal to participate in their self congratulatory social gatherings and their disconnection from <strong>the point </strong>of what magic should provide - a sense of wonder - and their focus on tricks and stealing them from others without originality mirrors some of the disillusionment I feel from so many people posturing for a slice of the internet pie that must seem so easy to grab a piece of. The mobile and web has created yet another gold rush and has inundated us with poseurs and smug wave after wave of founders, co-founders, presidents, CEOs, and whatever other title of the day people are giving themselves in company after company that they continually spin off, pivot, bootstrap, aquihire - blogging, tweeting, speaking at conferences, and generally spewing the image they want of themselves out into the world incessantly, trying to reach for those streetlights, so they can bow out, cash out and...what then, exactly? Wait for the next gold rush? I'd venture to guess that many of these people are in the game of feeding their ego, and if a new wave of financial opportunity came raining down in the form of new widgets, they'd line up right next to all the other widget makers, selling their services, offering to teach you how to make new and better widgets, and promising to change the world of widgets in a way nobody has ever done before - that they know of, at least...</p>
<p>If people gave 1% of the effort they've spent on marketing and imagemaking and applied it to learning and applying the craft they'd like the world to think them a part of, where could we be today instead? So much time and potential is flushed away in these falsities.</p>
<p>Granted, there are always vocal minorities which paint an ugly picture of the hardworking and dedicated masses, and this case is no different than any other. Still, in Ricky James' honor, I feel that separating from and calling out the fakers when we see them should be the responsibility of everyone who wants to keep some of the art in what we do for a living -  back when it wasn't about investors and monetization schemes and ad revenue - back in our mother's basements as children, hunched over keyboards in the dark, pecking through history and finding the wonder and magic behind the screen.</p>

				<title>ON EMPATHY AND LEADERSHIP</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The greatest leaders have a strong ability to empathize with their team. Leadership is not task management nor is it riding people to perform the minute details you think they need to perform to achieve your vision. True leadership recognizes that you need the people following you much more than they need you - without an understanding of their motivations or abilities, you'll likely be unable to relate your goals to theirs. 
<!--more-->
Dr. Saad Al Barrak, former CEO of the highly successful Zain, called it "<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3002490/perils-ignoring-softer-side-management" title="THE PERILS OF IGNORING THE SOFTER SIDE OF MANAGEMENT">Soft Management</a>". He argues very convincingly that by aligning people's personal goals with your goals, and thus the organization's goals, you can reach new heights that cannot be reached by just having people sleepwalk through a micro managed point A to B to C. Aside from creating a culture that doesn't dare to dream, you only serve to reach point C in the best case scenario of this prodding form of leadership, which eventually causes churn and turnover that contributes negatively to your culture to the point where it <strong>becomes</strong> your culture. 

Getting to know your team members, recognizing how to best orient them towards their own goals and interest, and recognizing that by doing so you're not only serving to help them become better at their chosen careers nor only to help them actualize as individuals, but that you're also giving them true ownership that will catapult their ability to contribute positively to your organizations' goals and to elevate your potential well past point A, B, or C. All that without the culture of mistrust and apathy that evolves from a leadership style of pushing people in directions only you want them to go.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>CAREFUL WITH THAT AXE, EUGENE</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Like lots of people who have been around technology for a while, I don't have much of a classical business upbringing. This general ignorance of The Rules has helped create new styles of management and work environments that offer a whole lot of benefits over The Old Ways in my father's days of computer-less desks, cigarette smoke heavy in the air, and not wearing a tie about as casual as a Friday got. 

Still, when it comes to leadership, it's good to be a little atavistic about watching what we say, and when we say it. Formality isn't always a four letter word and can instead help to guard you about saying things that can't be unsaid.
<!--more-->
In today's more casual workplace, we can all too easily let our guard down and forget that we're not always speaking as friends with our coworkers, but are also the leaders of the company. While it's important to be vocal and communicate transparently with your team and peers, it's equally if not more important to think before speaking, and listen more than talk. Finding out where your team's head is at gives you the light to guide the way, pontificating more likely serves your own ego rather than your team's, and won't do much to guide you or anyone out of darkness.

Sharing information once it's well thought out, defined, and concrete has value for your team, but doing so when it's just a developing thought can be easily misinterpreted by your team. When you're in a leadership position, your team looks to you for rock solid guidance. If you're sharing half baked ideas and "wouldn't it be nice if's...", it's deservedly going to look like you're just playing things by ear. If you don't take the direction of the company seriously enough to plan ahead before guiding your company, then why should anyone else? Guess what - they won't. Not only does this behavior introduce a reasonable amount of fear that You Have No Idea What You're Doing, but it also has the likely outcome of weakening your company's belief in you, the company's future, and whether they want to be there for what is quickly looking like a bumpy ride.

It's your burden as a leader to think through your thoughts well before disseminating them among your team. Sure, companies shift focus and it's imperative that you make those shifts for your survival and growth. Only make them once they're well formed, and only get everyone else on board when you're ready to explain the minutiae of "how?", "why?", and "when?".  Once something is vocalized to the rest of the group, especially by someone in a leadership position, it is analyzed and dissected way more than you may have intended. I hear so many stories of crushing student debt, the high costs of health insurance, difficult to rent apartments, and so many other Real World Fears that are on all of our minds and <strong>especially</strong> those of the younger workforce that I've had on my teams, that I just can't with a clear conscience add any more uncertainty to their lives and introduce unnecessary risks for them, which will directly translate to risks for me and the company if I'm not careful. If I or the others on the leadership team just riff with them some random thoughts in our heads about things we'd be interested in doing someday, projects that'd be great to check out, and other seemingly unimportant things that I'm not really committing to - I'm failing as a leader. I haven't thought through the effects it's likely to have on my teammates who are, very often, looking for stability in an unstable world. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Informal check ins keep a clear path of communication open between you and the rest of the team. When you ask for candid feelings or thoughts, you're more likely to get them when you've established a communication pathway that's trusted and real rather than formal, stiff, and unnatural. Having a real relationship with people you work with actually reduces context switching, too, because you can very quickly interact with someone rather than setting up a meeting (which tend to suck out time and productivity) and formalizing the event. Who knew that being a real person had benefits in the workplace? 

The bottom line is that the closer you are to your team as people, knowing what they're thinking and when they're in a good or a bad mood, the closer you are to working together to create a better workplace and get things done. You become more aware of the feelings and energy of the team producing work and are also that much more likely to correct issues earlier in the process. It's like iterative development - you constantly check your work instead of all at once in the end, when it's likely too late or too much effort to do anything about it.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>CONSISTENCY AS CULTURE</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a leader, you need to work hard to ensure that as your company's goals change, they change with full transparency and buy in from everyone in the organization. Oftentimes, change can be perceived as a red flag for many of the people at your company. For them, the sacrifices, expended time, passion, energy, and more were all made in the name of achieving the goals that helped create and grow your organization, and any directional changes can demoralize and devalue those sacrifices.

Obviously, in business goals often need to change for the sake of staying alive and thriving in a constantly changing marketplace. However, it's of the upmost importance that they shouldn't leave a trail of destruction through your culture as they do so. Establishing early on what your culture stands for is the cornerstone of surviving change. Culture is not what you say, it's what you do and what you value. When you allow your culture to change, it is due to your disassociation from your original values and from the work done daily that's actually keeping the company alive, a disconnect on the leadership's part to understand what the company actually does, and a sign that leadership and the rest of the company are working in two very different worlds. If you don't experience the pain points, you cannot empathize with the difficulties you're asking your team to deal with, especially when you need to nimbly shift your company's business. Morale drops, further worsening culture from the inside out because it is no longer a culture lived organically by every person in the company but instead hardens from the bottom up. By the time it makes it up the proverbial ivory tower, it's too late to react.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>THAT TIME I TRIED TO DEFINE THE UNDEFINABLE</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For art to be meaningful, I feel that it must be decontextualized. By this I mean that it should be removed from culture and personal history and instead related to a greater human truth, the kind which crosses all boundaries of culture, time, gender, or experience. If I were to be lifted from my body today and moved to the middle period of the Great Egyptian Dynasties or teleported into the halls of Ancient Greece, I should still be able to marvel and be touched by the art that they generated in their times, regardless of the oceans of time between my experiences and those of artists. Granted, this is perhaps too strict a definition of art as it eliminates a great deal of what can only otherwise be defined as art from today's generally accepted definition, but I feel that those modern and more narrow expressions of self need to be recategorized and bucketed into a new word.
<!--more-->

I feel that the art that pushed me away - that alienated me for years - was so often rooted in a hyper-individualistic focus. Too often, this kind of art which I, in my limited exposure, experienced was rooted in personal histories of the artist and feelings that only made sense when viewed through that lens. They were stories of memories, of youth, of families. While indeed these are forms of personal expression which are valid, valuable, useful, meaningful, and relevant to life both modern and not, I do not feel they touch upon the nerve of human truth in a way that can elicit a human reaction on a global and timeless scale. They are local in their expression and thus localized in their value and ability to affect reaction in others.

&nbsp;
<h1>That Time Things Got Weird</h1>
To begin to define the universal art, the universal truth, we must first establish some model of Reality which we can agree upon. The universe and cosmos, the galaxies and the engines that create stars, the moons and the planets of the systems that revolve around them while rotating around themselves, everything from the big bang to the big silence which inevitably follows exists within this true Reality. However, like a camera taking a picture of itself, as we are embedded and within this Reality, we can never fully capture what It Is, as this Reality is greater than the universe and everything within it, on a scale we cannot easily comprehend. While I obviously cannot begin to express what it is that created this Reality, where or how it exists, or how it will persist or end, I do feel that a simplified view of it can be created which will be sufficient for us to define what Art is in relation to this Reality. The endless mobius strip or an impossible shape of a trumpet which blows into itself and whose insides are outside through the horn to form the outside pulled back again is how I picture (in a completely inaccurate way) Reality. The vibration created by this Reality across the many dimensions that we know and that we do not know create excitement of the sub-atomic sub-quark elemental units that make up this Reality, and this excitation moves energy. These building blocks join into more complex structures until finally we see electrons, protons, neutrons, atoms, elements, all the way on up until I sit here typing on this computer in front of me. Now, the initial blowing of this trumpet that created this excitation and thus the universe - or universes - within them to which we belong will eventually reach silence. There is no option - the neutral state is the start and goal state - everything in between is existence. This neutral state, the lowest energy level, diminishment to zero (or Beyond the Zero?), is to us a calming and peaceful emotion because it is - by the nature of Reality - the birth/death state. As Reality rings out in vibration we the components within it form ourselves into different arrangements - some of which are stable and some of which are unstable. Stability denotes low energy, though some states are lower energy than others. This is our goal, to continually evolve (on these sub-atomic levels) until a low energy stable state can be formed, and like sound waves slowly diminishing we will continually do so until the state of zero is reached. Perhaps the trumpet sounds again at this point, but this is beyond my ability to understand and perhaps beyond our need to define for the purposes of art.

&nbsp;
<h1>OK, Weirdo, But How Does This Relate To Art?</h1>
Art is the term I use to define these stable states. Like Plato's allegory of the cave, while we cannot capture a glimpse of the Reality and instead are watching the shadows on the wall, Art is the shadow that most closely reminds us of the true beauty of the neutral state Reality that is: It.

art, with a little "a", is the story that the artist tells us by utilizing this truth about Art.

To explain to me your personal life history is expression.

To do so by recognizing the neutral Art state and by manipulating your expression so that it creates tension and release - stable and unstable states - you are expressing your story in relation to Art at large. This elevates art and the artist to a high degree and creates Universal Art. To watch a dancer contort, a sculpture carved from marble, a painting on a wall, a song, a performance, telling a story, or even how you carry yourself in the world can all be expressions of stability and unstability - a reminder of the truth of reality and from which we can be touched by regardless of our position in time or space.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What I love most about software is that it is excellent at doing exactly what you tell it to do, never veering from your instructions, never complaining, and doing it extremely quickly. These are not only excellent characteristics we can leverage for our own efficiency gains, but coincidentally things that humans like me are typically awful at. Finding a tool that does things you are bad at and does them well, quickly, and cheaply is so rare that we'd be remiss not to take full advantage of these quirks in its nature. In an attempt to leverage these powers for good, I'm sharing an in-progress project I've been working on called <a title="Robot Blocks on Github" href="https://github.com/mustafashabib/robotblocks">Robot Blocks</a>.

For my own uses, Robot Blocks has been helpful to quickly build up a project with a backend data store in my preferred framework, .NET. Inverting the pattern we used at <a href="http://www.wearemammoth.com">WAM</a>, I took an <a title="Entity Framework, Code First" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/jj193542.aspx">Entity Framework code first</a> approach that allowed me to organically design/build my data model and not worry too much about the backend details. I'd like to eventually make it a part of my build toolchain to update my backend as I develop. If I were building client facing apps, I'd longer term want to generate a simple front end admin tool for the database, and some simple tools to query/dump the data for BI purposes.

<!--more-->

My friend <a title="Ka Wai Cheung" href="http://www.lifeimitatescode.com/">Ka Wai Cheung</a> and I have had great success over the years in leveraging <a title="Code Generation" href="https://wearemammoth.com/2009/05/when-you-follow-good-rules-code">code generation</a> and, for me, was a big reason for some of our successes at <a title="We Are Mammoth" href="http://www.wearemammoth.com">We Are Mammoth</a> in the early years. Code generation allowed us to deliver high quality and custom work for our customers at costs far below those of our competitors and also standardized a lot of our internal processes since all projects took on similar shapes and appearances, making developers more fungible as there was very little ramp up time to become effective at working with our many different project codebases. Of course, code generation and convention took a huge step into the limelight with projects like <a title="RoR" href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> which abstracted away a lot of the underlying boilerplate code and let people get to work and get things done, so we're by no means alone in our appreciation for this kind of an approach to software development, and especially web development.

I additionally like the fact that code is becoming much more of a lego block building game than it once was, with rich and powerful frameworks allowing us to quickly assemble more and more complex pieces. Robot Blocks' name is a nod to the new reality of writing software based on <a title="DNA" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/DNA_Structure%2BKey%2BLabelled.pn_NoBB.png">previously successful examples you may have heard of </a>where simple components collaborate to form new and advanced wholes...

It's still a work in progress, but does a relatively good job generating an initial data schema using SQL, for now, though there's some work to be done in updating databases after the initial generation.

Please feel free to share and contribute to the project. Though EF and similar projects exist in the same niche, something more lightweight and, to me, simpler, seems worthwhile.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>BE A VALVE</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As my career has progressed, I've realized that the majority of my work involves being a valve on my team. What that means to me is that essentially, most of my value is in deciding when I should <strong>block </strong>or <strong>unblock </strong>something or someone.

<!--more-->This manifests in many different ways in my day to day work, but typically I will start my mornings performing code reviews. The code review process is probably one of the most valuable and powerful ways to not only increase visibility across teams in how something works, but also an excellent source of knowledge and learning that can very quickly ramp up new engineers and expose them to best practices in a much more effective way than documentation -- which most people do not write well nor reference as often as they should. As a valve, during code review I do my best to ensure that I am not unnecessarily blocking progress by not reviewing in a timely manner, but I also often block progress at this step to ensure that designs are being implemented as expected, standards remain high, and that everyone understands how or why things work the way do.

After code review, I tend to view our team's input queue to ensure that again we are blocking or unblocking as needed on feature requests, tickets, or general questions on how systems work. Not only does this help external teams but also ensures that the company as a whole is moving efficiently. I also know that it improves standards all the way around and that when I'm on the other side of someone else's input queue, we too will get better service as a result.

Our daily standup is the next opportunity I have to play the valve -- I tend to keep my updates short and focused on answering three main questions:
<ol>
	<li>What progress have I made since yesterday?</li>
	<li>What am I doing today?</li>
	<li>What issues am I facing that may jeopardize my progress today or in the near future?</li>
</ol>
Each of those questions help define how the flow of work is proceeding -- whether things are flowing smoothly and progressing or whether they are or need to be paused to allow for some other flow to cross or merge into the main flow.

Though it's a simple concept, viewing myself in this way has helped me very quickly make decisions in the face of constant ambiguity. My gut feeling about whether I need more information or need to influence someone to do something other than what they think let's me answer questions quickly, set expectations appropriately, and continue to improve the quality of work we do as a team.]]></content:encoded>
