<p>For art to be meaningful, I feel that it must be decontextualized. By this I mean that it should be removed from culture and personal history and instead related to a greater human truth, the kind which crosses all boundaries of culture, time, gender, or experience. If I were to be lifted from my body today and moved to the middle period of the Great Egyptian Dynasties or teleported into the halls of Ancient Greece, I should still be able to marvel and be touched by the art that they generated in their times, regardless of the oceans of time between my experiences and those of artists. Granted, this is perhaps too strict a definition of art as it eliminates a great deal of what can only otherwise be defined as art from today's generally accepted definition, but I feel that those modern and more narrow expressions of self need to be recategorized and bucketed into a new word.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p>I feel that the art that pushed me away - that alienated me for years - was so often rooted in a hyper-individualistic focus. Too often, this kind of art which I, in my limited exposure, experienced was rooted in personal histories of the artist and feelings that only made sense when viewed through that lens. They were stories of memories, of youth, of families. While indeed these are forms of personal expression which are valid, valuable, useful, meaningful, and relevant to life both modern and not, I do not feel they touch upon the nerve of human truth in a way that can elicit a human reaction on a global and timeless scale. They are local in their expression and thus localized in their value and ability to affect reaction in others.</p>

<h1>That Time Things Got Weird</h1>
<p>To begin to define the universal art, the universal truth, we must first establish some model of Reality which we can agree upon. The universe and cosmos, the galaxies and the engines that create stars, the moons and the planets of the systems that revolve around them while rotating around themselves, everything from the big bang to the big silence which inevitably follows exists within this true Reality. However, like a camera taking a picture of itself, as we are embedded and within this Reality, we can never fully capture what It Is, as this Reality is greater than the universe and everything within it, on a scale we cannot easily comprehend. While I obviously cannot begin to express what it is that created this Reality, where or how it exists, or how it will persist or end, I do feel that a simplified view of it can be created which will be sufficient for us to define what Art is in relation to this Reality. The endless mobius strip or an impossible shape of a trumpet which blows into itself and whose insides are outside through the horn to form the outside pulled back again is how I picture (in a completely inaccurate way) Reality. The vibration created by this Reality across the many dimensions that we know and that we do not know create excitement of the sub-atomic sub-quark elemental units that make up this Reality, and this excitation moves energy. These building blocks join into more complex structures until finally we see electrons, protons, neutrons, atoms, elements, all the way on up until I sit here typing on this computer in front of me. Now, the initial blowing of this trumpet that created this excitation and thus the universe - or universes - within them to which we belong will eventually reach silence. There is no option - the neutral state is the start and goal state - everything in between is existence. This neutral state, the lowest energy level, diminishment to zero (or Beyond the Zero?), is to us a calming and peaceful emotion because it is - by the nature of Reality - the birth/death state. As Reality rings out in vibration we the components within it form ourselves into different arrangements - some of which are stable and some of which are unstable. Stability denotes low energy, though some states are lower energy than others. This is our goal, to continually evolve (on these sub-atomic levels) until a low energy stable state can be formed, and like sound waves slowly diminishing we will continually do so until the state of zero is reached. Perhaps the trumpet sounds again at this point, but this is beyond my ability to understand and perhaps beyond our need to define for the purposes of art.</p>

<h1>OK, Weirdo, But How Does This Relate To Art?</h1>
<p>Art is the term I use to define these stable states. Like Plato's allegory of the cave, while we cannot capture a glimpse of the Reality and instead are watching the shadows on the wall, Art is the shadow that most closely reminds us of the true beauty of the neutral state Reality that is: It.</p>
<p>art, with a little "a", is the story that the artist tells us by utilizing this truth about Art.</p>
<p>To explain to me your personal life history is expression.</p>
<p>To do so by recognizing the neutral Art state and by manipulating your expression so that it creates tension and release - stable and unstable states - you are expressing your story in relation to Art at large. This elevates art and the artist to a high degree and creates Universal Art. To watch a dancer contort, a sculpture carved from marble, a painting on a wall, a song, a performance, telling a story, or even how you carry yourself in the world can all be expressions of stability and unstability - a reminder of the truth of reality and from which we can be touched by regardless of our position in time or space.</p>
