<p>Like lots of people who have been around technology for a while, I don't have much of a classical business upbringing. This general ignorance of The Rules has helped create new styles of management and work environments that offer a whole lot of benefits over The Old Ways in my father's days of computer-less desks, cigarette smoke heavy in the air, and not wearing a tie about as casual as a Friday got. </p>
<p>Still, when it comes to leadership, it's good to be a little atavistic about watching what we say, and when we say it. Formality isn't always a four letter word and can instead help to guard you about saying things that can't be unsaid.<br />

In today's more casual workplace, we can all too easily let our guard down and forget that we're not always speaking as friends with our coworkers, but are also the leaders of the company. While it's important to be vocal and communicate transparently with your team and peers, it's equally if not more important to think before speaking, and listen more than talk. Finding out where your team's head is at gives you the light to guide the way, pontificating more likely serves your own ego rather than your team's, and won't do much to guide you or anyone out of darkness.</p>
<p>Sharing information once it's well thought out, defined, and concrete has value for your team, but doing so when it's just a developing thought can be easily misinterpreted by your team. When you're in a leadership position, your team looks to you for rock solid guidance. If you're sharing half baked ideas and "wouldn't it be nice if's...", it's deservedly going to look like you're just playing things by ear. If you don't take the direction of the company seriously enough to plan ahead before guiding your company, then why should anyone else? Guess what - they won't. Not only does this behavior introduce a reasonable amount of fear that You Have No Idea What You're Doing, but it also has the likely outcome of weakening your company's belief in you, the company's future, and whether they want to be there for what is quickly looking like a bumpy ride.</p>
<p>It's your burden as a leader to think through your thoughts well before disseminating them among your team. Sure, companies shift focus and it's imperative that you make those shifts for your survival and growth. Only make them once they're well formed, and only get everyone else on board when you're ready to explain the minutiae of "how?", "why?", and "when?".  Once something is vocalized to the rest of the group, especially by someone in a leadership position, it is analyzed and dissected way more than you may have intended. I hear so many stories of crushing student debt, the high costs of health insurance, difficult to rent apartments, and so many other Real World Fears that are on all of our minds and <strong>especially</strong> those of the younger workforce that I've had on my teams, that I just can't with a clear conscience add any more uncertainty to their lives and introduce unnecessary risks for them, which will directly translate to risks for me and the company if I'm not careful. If I or the others on the leadership team just riff with them some random thoughts in our heads about things we'd be interested in doing someday, projects that'd be great to check out, and other seemingly unimportant things that I'm not really committing to - I'm failing as a leader. I haven't thought through the effects it's likely to have on my teammates who are, very often, looking for stability in an unstable world. </p>
