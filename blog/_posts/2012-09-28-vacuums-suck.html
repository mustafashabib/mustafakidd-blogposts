<p>It's common in technical fields to attract the more introverted personalities. Often, they've honed their skills over a period of years, working alone in their bedrooms and offices, absorbing content from manuals and documentation that nobody else reads. Even in today's hyper-connected world where there's a forum of likeminded individuals studying the same fields you're interested in, it's still very much mostly a solo endeavor. At the end of the day, you still need to sit down and create and implement a design, write code, test, deploy, and any number of other tasks related to today's tech world - and do it alone.</p>
<p>Because of this, there's a tendency for these personalities to retain a go at it alone attitude, even when working side by side with others in an organization on a complex project with many moving parts. This is true in a large organizations as well as small: In <a title="We Are Mammoth" href="http://wearemammoth.com">our company</a>, which is still tiny at under 20 people, <strong>attempting to work in a vacuum often creates problems</strong>.</p>

<h4>The Cost of Grinding It Out</h4>
<p>It isn't that there's no benefit to <a href="http://wearemammoth.com/2010/04/off-time-pragmatic-solution-to-leaving">alone time</a> -- there's obviously a need and a great deal of <a title="37s Alone Time" href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch07_Alone_Time.php" target="_blank">value</a> to it. The problems occur when you're so focused on the one task you have at hand that you don't bother to see how the part you're working on fits in with the components around it. You've created the proverbial square peg, which will soon need to be pounded in to the round hole that your teammates have just finished delicately carving out.</p>
<p>Additionally, when coupled with a <a title="MAKE MISTAKES" href="http://www.mustafakidd.com/?p=191" target="_blank">fear of making mistakes</a> and a crisis situation, working alone can very easily create more problems than what you were first confronted with. Soloists won't as readily share information so that the right people are notified, so stakeholders can put into action plans that may already be in place, and so that customers can be updated and expectations can be squared away. When you don't share problems, especially in a crisis, you become a part of the problem and introduce a bottle neck in the team's ability to solve it.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a title="MJ Gets Mad At Slash" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lxN7x8JVKM&amp;feature=g-vrec" target="_blank">soloing often <strong>wastes time</strong></a>. So often have I struggled with an issue, deep within the bowels of some ancient legacy code, when I suddenly emerge through the fog into a moment of clarity and realize: I should ask someone else around here what they think! When I do, we often discover the answer immediately due to some esoteric knowledge they had and I didn't. Keeping my head down and slogging through it, while often an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Mizrachi">admirable skill</a>, ends up being the wrong choice most of the time purely from an efficiency standpoint. For those of us lucky enough to work with <a href="http://wearemammoth.com/about#content">talented people</a>, <strong>not relying on their expertise is a wasted opportunity.</strong> It's a waste of resources and a wasted chance for you to learn something new - it's also a wasted chance for <strong>them </strong>to learn how to better publicize their knowledge, how to educate those around them, and how to improve the team in general.</p>
