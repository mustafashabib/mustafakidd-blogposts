<p>As a leader, you need to work hard to ensure that as your company's goals change, they change with full transparency and buy in from everyone in the organization. Oftentimes, change can be perceived as a red flag for many of the people at your company. For them, the sacrifices, expended time, passion, energy, and more were all made in the name of achieving the goals that helped create and grow your organization, and any directional changes can demoralize and devalue those sacrifices.</p>
<p>Obviously, in business goals often need to change for the sake of staying alive and thriving in a constantly changing marketplace. However, it's of the upmost importance that they shouldn't leave a trail of destruction through your culture as they do so. Establishing early on what your culture stands for is the cornerstone of surviving change. Culture is not what you say, it's what you do and what you value. When you allow your culture to change, it is due to your disassociation from your original values and from the work done daily that's actually keeping the company alive, a disconnect on the leadership's part to understand what the company actually does, and a sign that leadership and the rest of the company are working in two very different worlds. If you don't experience the pain points, you cannot empathize with the difficulties you're asking your team to deal with, especially when you need to nimbly shift your company's business. Morale drops, further worsening culture from the inside out because it is no longer a culture lived organically by every person in the company but instead hardens from the bottom up. By the time it makes it up the proverbial ivory tower, it's too late to react.</p>
