<blockquote cite="http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/cargocul.htm">In the South Seas there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw<br />
airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want the same<br />
thing to happen now. So they've arranged to imitate things like<br />
runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a<br />
wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head<br />
like headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas--he's<br />
the controller--and they wait for the airplanes to land. They're<br />
doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the<br />
way it looked before. But it doesn't work. No airplanes land. So<br />
I call these things cargo cult science, because they follow all the<br />
apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but<br />
they're missing something essential, because the planes don't land.</p>

Richard Feynman gave a great <a title="Cargo Cult Science" href="http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/cargocul.htm">commencent address</a> in 1974 at Caltech which wonderfully described the "leaning over backwards" we must all strive for when presenting our ideas to others for judgement on their worthiness and value. The main thrust of his speech was aimed at helping us avoid the mistakes of hiding the truth, presenting only certain facts, or generally misleading people to support our ideas by not laying all evidence out in public for everyone to make up their own minds about. The integrity required to behave in this manner - to be as open about your failings as you are about your successes - is of the utmost importance for each of us to be true to ourselves and doubly as important to ensure that we can trust one another. Without this integrity and trust, cooperation could be stifled, and thus progress.</p>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, this trust can only be achieved when we each make the effort to fully vet and understand other's claims, to ensure we are all working with the same basic knowledge, and to know when things are right or when they are wrong. It is not enough just to take other's results, methodology, or process and expect to be able to build something stable upon it.</p>
<h4>Dig Deeper</h4>
<p>In technology, it reminds me a great deal of the importance of <strong>digging deeper</strong>. Too often, I come across code that <em>looks </em>like code I've seen before - it seems to follow a certain organizational pattern, but then has some huge core component missing. In these cases, it's clear that the developer has taken it upon themselves to don the bamboo headphones and wait for the never arriving planes of the cargo cult and is merely <strong>mimicking</strong> someone else's poorly understood success and hoping to find success of their own.</p>
<p>Feynman's advice is as sound for us developers as it is for anyone else: understand the reasons, the context, and the methods to replicate someone else's success before deciding that you should build a superficial clone of their ideas. You may find that their solution was very particular, specific to a need you do not have - or perhaps you'll find that it's actually not that great of a solution to begin with. In other cases, you'll understand some deeper meaning behind their results and process, and can thus leverage it for your own experiments and work in a way that has true value instead of just as window dressing.</p>
<h4>Skepticism</h4>
<p>Though it seems obvious, I can't stress enough the importance of being skeptical to allow you to build a stronger foundation of knowledge. Understanding the hows and whys of new tools and methodologies on your own  must be a core requirement before you can apply them and their lessons to your own work. A good idea will be supported by good reasoning, by transparency, and by repeatability. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't quite explain to yourself why you're doing something a certain way, pause and ask yourself whether you understand it or whether you're out in the South Pacific somewhere waiting for the planes to come.</p>
