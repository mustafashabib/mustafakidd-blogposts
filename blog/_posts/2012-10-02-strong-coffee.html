<p>As of late, there's a <a href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure">lot</a> of <a href="http://rainypixels.com/words/the-story-of-the-new-microsoft-com/">great</a> <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/">stuff</a> I <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en/us/default.aspx">like</a> about what Microsoft has been up to. They're more open, more transparent, and more connected than they've ever been - and I think the result of all this is a more relevant company than they've been in a long time. Today, Microsoft announced <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> as one more attempt to reach out to developers, make their lives easier, and make the web a more open place and a platform that's easier than ever to develop for.</p>

<p><a href="http://tirania.org/blog">Miguel de Icaza</a> does a <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2012/Oct-01.html">great job</a> rounding up the pros and cons of this release, so I won't rehash it here. I think some of the cons and barriers to adoptability that he mentions Linux and Mac developers will face shouldn't be barriers for very long. Some of the initial syntax definitions <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/interoperability/archive/2012/10/01/sublime-text-vi-emacs-typescript-enabled.aspx">available</a> already make this more attractive to non Windows developers.</p>
<p>All in all - I think it's a worthy contribution to the landscape and, along with some other <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dart/">excellent tools</a> addressing similar problems and having similar goals, it only adds to developer's abilities to efficiently write <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Solid-Microsoft-Programming-Series/dp/1556155514">solid code</a>.</p>
