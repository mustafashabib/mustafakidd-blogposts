<p>We have a framed <a title="Anthony Burrill's work" href="http://www.anthonyburrill.com/purchase/work-hard.html">picture</a> at <a title="We Are Mammoth" href="http://wearemammoth.com">our office</a> that says "Work Hard and Be Nice to People". Simple and pithy? Yes, of course - all good mantras need to be.</p>
<p>As my years in the industry have inched past a decade, I've been exposed to more and more types of projects, unique (sometimes great, sometimes not so great) personalities, and various hot new tech fads that will Solve Everything. The more things change, though, the more I keep coming back to <strong>this</strong> idea as the <strong>single most important </strong>point in my personal Code Of Ethics. Work Hard. Be Nice to people.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I've been fortunate enough to work with some <a title="Adam Hoffman" href="http://www.stratospher.es/">amazing</a> <a title="Ka Wai Cheung's The Developer's Code" href="http://www.thedeveloperscode.com/">folks</a> over the years that have helped cement, for me, the understanding that while talent and skill are indeed huge components to each of our successes and paths in life, they're usurped by the attitude with which you approach difficult situations. The attitude helps define how we spend our day to day and the environments we live and work in.  Nothing counts as much as<strong> being a nice person: </strong>To care about your work but also to care about the your coworkers' and clients' struggles and to lend a helping hand.</p>
<p>I'm always more interested in working with people who are nice, who care about the people they're working with, and want to help ease their pain when facing problems. Who you are when things are going swell is one thing, but what you did and how you acted when things were tough are often the brief moments that crystallize who you are, both to yourself and to those around you.</p>
<p>The dynamic that's emitted from relationships where everyone cares about one another can overcome any difficulty regardless of the expertise of each individual involved who is working on the problem. I'll take a handful of folks who care about each other, who know enough to get their bearings, and who want to see each other through any problems over a handful of domain experts who don't care to help you if it doesn't suit their personal schedule or needs, who point to their job description anytime requests come to them and say "<em>that's not my</em> job", or who reluctantly do you the favor of giving you a few moments of their time when you need it most - that sort of attitude is the tech office equivalent of <a href="http://lakersblog.latimes.com/.a/6a00d8341c506253ef015435900d7c970c-600wi">locker room poison</a>. People quickly learn to work around such obstacles at the cost of effort and time, our most important resources, and "one bad apple" can demoralize an entire group and sap them of motivation and energy. I've seen groups coalesce into those who work well with one another and those who don't, causing further schism within an office and more tension and lack of trust than anyone would deem healthy. You spend so much of your time around your clients and coworkers that it makes no sense not to be nice. Why would you want to spend a third of your day, and probably close to half of your waking day, being a grump and offering resistance each time you have the opportunity to be flexible?</p>
