<p>The greatest leaders have a strong ability to empathize with their team. Leadership is not task management nor is it riding people to perform the minute details you think they need to perform to achieve your vision. True leadership recognizes that you need the people following you much more than they need you - without an understanding of their motivations or abilities, you'll likely be unable to relate your goals to theirs.<br />

Dr. Saad Al Barrak, former CEO of the highly successful Zain, called it "<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3002490/perils-ignoring-softer-side-management" title="THE PERILS OF IGNORING THE SOFTER SIDE OF MANAGEMENT">Soft Management</a>". He argues very convincingly that by aligning people's personal goals with your goals, and thus the organization's goals, you can reach new heights that cannot be reached by just having people sleepwalk through a micro managed point A to B to C. Aside from creating a culture that doesn't dare to dream, you only serve to reach point C in the best case scenario of this prodding form of leadership, which eventually causes churn and turnover that contributes negatively to your culture to the point where it <strong>becomes</strong> your culture. </p>
<p>Getting to know your team members, recognizing how to best orient them towards their own goals and interest, and recognizing that by doing so you're not only serving to help them become better at their chosen careers nor only to help them actualize as individuals, but that you're also giving them true ownership that will catapult their ability to contribute positively to your organizations' goals and to elevate your potential well past point A, B, or C. All that without the culture of mistrust and apathy that evolves from a leadership style of pushing people in directions only you want them to go.</p>
