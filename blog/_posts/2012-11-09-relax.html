<p>While listening to a <a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/post/2-0-2-pressure">great interview</a> over at <a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/">This Developer's Life</a>, I started thinking about how I personally deal with stress and pressure. We've had our share of catastrophes at <a href="http://wearemammoth.com">WAM</a>, like everyone in the game of software development it comes with the territory whether it's working on client projects or your own products. The scenarios are the same: something isn't working the way it's supposed to work, there's a problem you never saw before, and someone is upset - worse:<strong> they're looking at you to fix it</strong>.</p>
<p>Like so many times in life, you have two paths you can choose to follow in these situations, the way I see it. You can Panic or you can Relax.</p>
<p>I, being a child of the 80s, will always and forever listen to Frankie, and Frankie says "Relax". In addition to being an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyl5DlrsU90">amazing dance song</a>, it's also sound advice in almost any situation where it is an option.</p>

<h4>Think Clearly</h4>
<p>Being able to maintain a calm demeanor helps tremendously when you're faced with a stressful situation. For the type of software many of us work on, luckily, the true cost of the error is typically not measured in things that really count. Certainly it may cost money, it may affect your or your company's credibility (perhaps, but more on this later), or it may cost your customers annoyances and trouble which in turn domino and create losses for them as well. Yes, these things are real and should be avoided. Still, I can't help but keep things in perspective and try and relate these stresses to the entire realm of possible stresses that we can encounter in our lives, and happily I can say that the majority of problems fall on the "minor" end of the scale.</p>
<p>This perspective also lets me keep my wits about me and allow me to approach the problem in a systematic way. I can follow the process I would normally follow when investigating a problem under less stressful or hurried circumstances. When you let the heat of the moment engulf you, it clouds your judgement. It makes you panic and rush to implement "solutions" which end up triggering more problems. You'll make changes to your system without testing, without vetting on another environment, without documenting it - all of which will cost you again, later. When you panic you pull at straws, and while you may get lucky and find solutions more quickly this way, careful investigation is much more likely to lead to a real understanding of your problems and how to fix them.</p>
<p>Staying relaxed also shouldn't be seen as a sign that you don't care or that you're in no rush to fix the issue. Instead, it speaks more to how you approach problem solving, about how well you know your system, how well you can explain what happened, and how well you can talk about the steps you've taken to prevent it from happening again. Your co-workers, clients, and customers will all appreciate having you on their side when problems occur and you have a track record of solving them in this clear and concise way.</p>
