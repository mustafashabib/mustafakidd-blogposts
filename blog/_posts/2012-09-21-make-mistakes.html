<p>A couple of days ago, <a title="DoneDone" href="http://www.getdonedone.com">DoneDone</a> - the issue tracking tool (for humans) that I help work on at <a title="We Are Mammoth" href="http://wearemammoth.com">WAM</a> - experienced some downtime due to a server update which inadvertently rebooted our servers. While the fact that DoneDone was down for a short period wasn't anyone's idea of ideal, I can't help but get excited when we make mistakes because mistakes are the only currency I can create, and I can spend that currency on lessons that help make our organization better.</p>
<p><!--more-->As WAM has grown over the years from a small group of guys in a tiny room to a team of (as of today) 18 - 12 of whom are developers - our growth has offered us lots of opportunities to make a lot of mistakes. I'm proud to say that we've all taken full advantage of these opportunities, probably with myself leading the way.</p>
<p>In lots of other places I've been, the company culture was one where people fear mistakes. Fear making them. Fear admitting that they've made them, and Fear of the repercussions of making them: Fear of the inevitable is not healthy and is <strong>not a culture I value.</strong> This fear tends to create a more brittle organization, where nobody is flexible enough to take chances on new ideas, where fear freezes people's ability to take a thought, massage it into an idea, and develop it with others into a full fledged solution to a problem. Being flexible is a base requirement to being innovative, and innovation breeds solutions, and solutions are valuable. Anything to get us to that end should be celebrated. When you value mistakes, your organization from top to bottom can participate in improving instead of hiding their mistakes - which often lead to even bigger problems which cause even more difficulty for both the organization and the stakeholders you aim to serve.</p>
<p>So, here's how it works - when we make a mistake - <strong>we call on others to help us solve the problem at hand, immediately. </strong>It helps if your organization values <a title="BE NICE" href="http://www.mustafakidd.com/?p=101">being nice</a>. Once the fallout of the mistake is identified, corrected, and an honest explanation of what went wrong has been shared with everyone affected, we can begin learning from this mistake. We meet to discuss what went wrong, we ask each other - why did we do whatever it was we did that caused this mistake, and what made us think it was the right thing to do? When it makes sense, we document those reasons and we collectively decide how we can best capture a method or process which will help us avoid making these decisions in the future. We aim to fold it into our process, we may add it to our manual checklists, we decide if blocking certain actions in any automated systems we have in place makes sense. We learn from them, we get better, and we move forward with a better product, a better organization, and a more experienced and knowledgable team.</p>
