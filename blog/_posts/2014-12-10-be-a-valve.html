<p>As my career has progressed, I've realized that the majority of my work involves being a valve on my team. What that means to me is that essentially, most of my value is in deciding when I should <strong>block </strong>or <strong>unblock </strong>something or someone.</p>
<p><!--more-->This manifests in many different ways in my day to day work, but typically I will start my mornings performing code reviews. The code review process is probably one of the most valuable and powerful ways to not only increase visibility across teams in how something works, but also an excellent source of knowledge and learning that can very quickly ramp up new engineers and expose them to best practices in a much more effective way than documentation -- which most people do not write well nor reference as often as they should. As a valve, during code review I do my best to ensure that I am not unnecessarily blocking progress by not reviewing in a timely manner, but I also often block progress at this step to ensure that designs are being implemented as expected, standards remain high, and that everyone understands how or why things work the way do.</p>
<p>After code review, I tend to view our team's input queue to ensure that again we are blocking or unblocking as needed on feature requests, tickets, or general questions on how systems work. Not only does this help external teams but also ensures that the company as a whole is moving efficiently. I also know that it improves standards all the way around and that when I'm on the other side of someone else's input queue, we too will get better service as a result.</p>
<p>Our daily standup is the next opportunity I have to play the valve -- I tend to keep my updates short and focused on answering three main questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What progress have I made since yesterday?</li>
<li>What am I doing today?</li>
<li>What issues am I facing that may jeopardize my progress today or in the near future?</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of those questions help define how the flow of work is proceeding -- whether things are flowing smoothly and progressing or whether they are or need to be paused to allow for some other flow to cross or merge into the main flow.</p>
<p>Though it's a simple concept, viewing myself in this way has helped me very quickly make decisions in the face of constant ambiguity. My gut feeling about whether I need more information or need to influence someone to do something other than what they think let's me answer questions quickly, set expectations appropriately, and continue to improve the quality of work we do as a team.</p>
