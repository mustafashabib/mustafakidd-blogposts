<p>Informal check ins keep a clear path of communication open between you and the rest of the team. When you ask for candid feelings or thoughts, you're more likely to get them when you've established a communication pathway that's trusted and real rather than formal, stiff, and unnatural. Having a real relationship with people you work with actually reduces context switching, too, because you can very quickly interact with someone rather than setting up a meeting (which tend to suck out time and productivity) and formalizing the event. Who knew that being a real person had benefits in the workplace? </p>
<p>The bottom line is that the closer you are to your team as people, knowing what they're thinking and when they're in a good or a bad mood, the closer you are to working together to create a better workplace and get things done. You become more aware of the feelings and energy of the team producing work and are also that much more likely to correct issues earlier in the process. It's like iterative development - you constantly check your work instead of all at once in the end, when it's likely too late or too much effort to do anything about it.</p>
