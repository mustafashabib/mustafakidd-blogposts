<p>One of the principles I live by both in my professional as well as personal life is to appreciate what's come before me. Recognizing that while there are often opportunities for improvement, decisions made before you were around are what allowed you the opportunity you have today to make things better.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I again thought about this as I read a <a title="Ricky James interviewed by the New Yorker" href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1993/04/05/1993_04_05_054_TNY_CARDS_000362341?currentPage=all">great interview with Ricky James that the New Yorker published back in 1993</a>. Ricky is held in extremely high regard by all those familiar with him - from fans to most importantly his own peers - for his considerable technical and social skills, style, wit, and charm. What elevates Ricky above the rest, I'd argue however, is his deep held respect for the past and for those that came before him, paving the road he walks today.</p>
<h1>He’s appalled that they haven’t read this stuff</h1>
<p>Though it's given him the reputation as being aloof, Ricky's inability to comprehend his supposed peer's disinterest in their craft and their lack of education and commitment to it is precisely what allows him to reintroduce techniques and tricks that nobody else is capable of, let alone aware of.</p>
<p>We can all learn a valuable lesson from Ricky James' commitment to history and to learning, even if we aren't necessarily in his league (yet!) as far as our relative expertise in our chosen fields goes. Ricky's refusal to participate in their self congratulatory social gatherings and their disconnection from <strong>the point </strong>of what magic should provide - a sense of wonder - and their focus on tricks and stealing them from others without originality mirrors some of the disillusionment I feel from so many people posturing for a slice of the internet pie that must seem so easy to grab a piece of. The mobile and web has created yet another gold rush and has inundated us with poseurs and smug wave after wave of founders, co-founders, presidents, CEOs, and whatever other title of the day people are giving themselves in company after company that they continually spin off, pivot, bootstrap, aquihire - blogging, tweeting, speaking at conferences, and generally spewing the image they want of themselves out into the world incessantly, trying to reach for those streetlights, so they can bow out, cash out and...what then, exactly? Wait for the next gold rush? I'd venture to guess that many of these people are in the game of feeding their ego, and if a new wave of financial opportunity came raining down in the form of new widgets, they'd line up right next to all the other widget makers, selling their services, offering to teach you how to make new and better widgets, and promising to change the world of widgets in a way nobody has ever done before - that they know of, at least...</p>
<p>If people gave 1% of the effort they've spent on marketing and imagemaking and applied it to learning and applying the craft they'd like the world to think them a part of, where could we be today instead? So much time and potential is flushed away in these falsities.</p>
<p>Granted, there are always vocal minorities which paint an ugly picture of the hardworking and dedicated masses, and this case is no different than any other. Still, in Ricky James' honor, I feel that separating from and calling out the fakers when we see them should be the responsibility of everyone who wants to keep some of the art in what we do for a living -  back when it wasn't about investors and monetization schemes and ad revenue - back in our mother's basements as children, hunched over keyboards in the dark, pecking through history and finding the wonder and magic behind the screen.</p>
